# bootstrap4-rwd

This repository contains the code-along examples and their modifications from my reading of the book:

> Bootstrap 4 - Responsive Web Design Leaning Path, Packt Publishing. 2016. 

This book repackages three previously published books:

1. Bootstrap 4 By Example,
2. Learning Bootstrap 4, and
3. Mastering Bootstrap 4.

I see no evidence of an "editor" in these books, so far. I do not necessarily recommend them. I have them, so I will read them â€” but how such bad prose made it into print I will need to ponder.

## A few notes  as I read.

### Module 1 - Bootstrap 4 By Example

The first book, *Bootstrap 4 By Example*, actually covers **Bootstrap 3**. The author writes as Bootstrap 4 enters alpha release (2016 ?). He promises in the preface to note any differences but failed to do do so from the very first example.

I used Bootstrap 4 and took the opportunity to exercise my "technical sophistication" by researching the up-to-date methods in Bootstrap 4. I ended up doing the Lynda course, *Bootstrap 4 Essential Training*, just so I could follow along with the book.

It's not a bad way to learn: to constantly repair and modify the examples as you work through them.
